<!-- im not talking to you bc you literally make me act incredibly out of character, e.g. insane and then i dont want to share m s k c c IP by accident -- so no im not talking to you UNLESS you email/call me -->
<!-- when im not remote, im in the m s k c c joy building (precisely the adjacent macklowe building (theres an indoor walkway), 5th floor), its super nice inside, i take an uber/cab from the port authority bc ... umm i dont like taking the MTA at rush hour?? personal preference?? its gross?? i dunno ... they do charge me for congestion pricing but i like having a cab to myself, we get interesting seminar speakers, im on a few projects and one of them is a ml project ... still lots to learn, i want to be a senior computational biologist in a few years, i have other things im looking forward to that i wont mention here. my brother successfully defended his phd in cs, his fiance is an attorney in nyc shes nice and is a big reader, we're going to his umd commencement next week in my dad's tesla (long road trip to MD, first time in a tesla + supercharging), i got a nice spring dress for his commencement from saks, still havent tried it on yet so busy with work, i got a herman miller embody gaming chair (i dont play video games) last week and its like one of the best purchases ive made ever lol ... work is good, everyone is super nice and super smart, i got a canon mirrorless camera but i only used it once for my brother's engagement a few months ago, hope to use it in the summer. yeah i really dont want to talk to you like this bc its dumb now?? just email/call me back ... one day or come by to joy, our work coffee place is tenz on 1st ave ... good strong coffee, ill take you out. ok bye -->
<!-- oh yeah, theres a former penn person here who was a bioinformatician there when i was there, diff group, but they said there were lawsuits going on ... like their PI was known to get into frivolous lawsuits with other labs and no one wanted to work with them, interesting right?? they also said it was a toxic workplace 
oh i didnt really say much in that conversation, i was just listening ... trying to understand why theres so much lawyer stuff happening at penn?? but it was interesting to hear that
maybe ill talk to you again after the summer, i just want to be alone, not update anyone on what im doing ... live in peace?? figure out what makes me happy ... right now that's work and learning more ml/python umm so yeah, ill ttyl bye

i dont know what to do, i want to tell you so much stuff but i dont know what you're doing .. why are you pursuing me if you're not single, i dont get that

im done with my required work for the week, working on pipeline/ml project today and tomorrow, we're analyzing clinical bulk rna-seq data and my team is working on the immune signatures aspect of that ... would be a great paper

i feel like talking to you today ... it feels right but i hate that you cant respond so like ...

this is the dress i got for my brother's commencement next week https://www.aliceandolivia.com/cora-shirt-dress/CC504P02523G178.html its like spring time ... im OOO next wednesday-friday, gonna be in maryland/DC

after my m s k c c coworker talked about the lawsuits going on at penn ... i was like ... ohh is this all really real then? is that why you cant talk to me

in my working group for immune signatures, there was someone who USE to be at WCM, now they're at m s k c c, and i wanted to ask if they knew you, but i was like, you dont respond to emails so i dont care what you're doing, i dunno, i think they prolly know you ... so we were 1 degree separated by this person ... lol

alright i got slack messaged, have some work to do now ... i love m s k c c so far, its all the good stuff i liked from previous jobs, the culture is great, people are super nice and super smart

you know, they said i scored a 9/10 on the programming assignment for this position at m s k c c, and usually people score a 5/10, and i was their most well liked candidate ... so they introduce me as a great programmer to new teams, which is true, i didnt waste my time during downtimes, i always tried to grow and learn new things. both python and R are big here, maybe there will be an opportunity to use some Rust i dunno

that person who use to be at WCM and is now at m s k c c was saying that m s k c c and the labs have a rigorous interview process bc they want to make sure the person they hire isnt "problematic", i feel like the culture here is very good ... yeah problematic people in academia are just bad for so many reasons, they cause a lot of damage

there was some cancer AI company that presented their AI tool during this once a month? meeting where all the computational biologists in every lab/team is in attendence and theres an interesting presentation ... anyway, a few days after their presentation, we got an email ... including me!! lol i got an email, that their terms of agreement to use the cancer AI tool violates some m s k c c IP rule so we cant use it lol  

im glad i got laid off from my previous position otherwise i would have never looked for another ... more challenging ... job, things are def better now, im around a better team, its not industry but its more interesting research ... ive wanted to work in nyc since 2014 ... so many interviews and years later, finally am doing it

welp, the suns not coming out today, another cloudy day >:|
